      <description>In this series of blogposts, I will document my experience of porting the game that I am currently working on to the jai programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s currently written in mostly D and some C++ and comes in at exactly 58,620 lines of code (excluding libraries). I&amp;rsquo;ve planned on doing this for a long time and want to keep some sort of record of my expectations, the journey and the result. And since every self-respecting programmer needs to start a blog at some point - why not share the process with the internet?</description>
